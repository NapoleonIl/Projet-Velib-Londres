# Projet-Velib-Londres
What are we ?
--A project to **analyze a data set** and **build a regression model**.

The approach will therefore be as follows:
1. descriptive analysis of the dataset: size of the dataset, type of variables available, missing/aberrant observations, etc.
2. analysis of the variables in the dataset: univariate treatments (distribution, fit to a theoretical distribution, etc.)
3. analysis of the relationship between the variable to be explained and the other variables in the dataset
4. construction of simple regression models
5. construction of a multiple regression model, taking into account any crossovers between variables,
6. if possible, PCA followed by AHC.

*Parts 4 and 5 are to be done in SAS, part 6 in R. There are no constraints for parts 1 to 3.
